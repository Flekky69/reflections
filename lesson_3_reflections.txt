When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you need to collaborate with somebody else

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
it could be related to conflicts management

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks is a remote clone of a remote repository (remote = in GitHub)
clones is a clone (local) of a local or remote repository
branch is a commit history (so a set of related commits) on a repository
Clone needs to be used to clone locally a repository, fork to clone remotly a remote repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Because you can understand what haeppened in case of conflicting commits between your local branch and remote branch knowing what haeppened since last aligned commit

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
it would be more complex and harder as there wouldn't be a version control system
